							We love podcasting! After we released our first episodes by
							manually copying files to servers, making sure our MP3 metadata
							matched the episode's description, updating our RSS feed, and
							setting up the Web site for each of the episodes, we realized
							there had to be a better way. Because the major services lacked
							all the features that we found necessary, we set out to make a
							great podcasting platform. And, it's coming soon for you to use,
							too.

							While many podcasts feature the voice of a single talented
							individual, we find that podcasts with multiple voices have
							higher ratings. We make this easy for you by allowing you to
							find other great voices with whom you can collaborate. Or, you
							can just invite your friends to join you on your next episode.
							Whatever you decide, you can easily grow your conversation with
							the world.

							It's vitally important that you get as much information about
							your audience as possible. We believe that you shouldn't have
							to shell out big money to get access to as much data as you
							can get from people accessing and downloading your podcasts.
							Every single podcast gets the same high-quality information
							availabe for review, visualization, and download. It's your
							audience, after all.

							Finding sponsors for your podcast can be an incredibly hard

							to find, approach, and schedule messages for your sponsors. You
							can share your audience data to get just the right companies.
							Then, collaborate on scripts with your sponsor and provide the
							recorded announcement to them for review in advance of your
							recording session.

							To get the best quality audio during a recording session, we have
							found the best solution is to have an individual audio file for
							each person participating. Most people, though, don't have the
							time to get everything set up and working. Our solution is simple:
							have each voice recorded	separately on our servers. Then, you can
							download each of the files for the best-sounding episodes!
