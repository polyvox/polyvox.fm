      While many podcasts feature the voice of a single talented
      individual, we find that podcasts with multiple voices have
      higher ratings. We make this easy for you by allowing you to
      find other great voices with whom you can collaborate. Or, you
      can just invite your friends to join you on your next episode.
      Whatever you decide, you can easily grow your conversation with
      the world.

      It's vitally important that you get as much information about
      your audience as possible. We believe that you shouldn't have
      to shell out big money to get access to as much data as you
      can get from people accessing and downloading your podcasts.
      Every single podcast gets the same high-quality information
      availabe for review, visualization, and download. It's your
      audience, after all.

      Finding sponsors for your podcast can be an incredibly hard
      undertaking. That's why we're creating an easy-to-use marketplace
      to find, approach, and schedule messages for your sponsors. You
      can share your audience data to get just the right companies.
      Then, collaborate on scripts with your sponsor and provide the
      recorded announcement to them for review in advance of your
      recording session.

      To get the best quality audio during a recording session, we have
      found the best solution is to have an individual audio file for
      each person participating. Most people, though, don't have the
      time to get everything set up and working. Our solution is simple:
      have each voice recorded separately on our servers. Then, you can
      download each of the files for the best-sounding episodes!
