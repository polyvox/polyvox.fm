			<p>Hey, Bryan and Heather, my friends and colleagues!</p>
			<p>
				I designed two prototypes for a marketing site as anchors
				for a conversation about our presence before launch. You
				can click links, below, to check them out.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since we're an audio medium, I thought it would be nice
				to highlight the nature of our platform with an integrated
				audio segment that welcomes users to sign-up for the
				platform. We could expand that with audio segments drilling
				down into each feature, for example.
			<dl>
				<dt><a href="./waveform.html">Waveform</a></dt>
				<dd>
					The waveform shows an oscilloscope-like visualization of the
					introductory audio stream describing the awesomeness that
					will be polyvox.fm.
				</dd>
				<dt><a href="./ripples.html">Ripples</a></dt>
				<dd>
					The ripples integrates the visualization of the introudctory
					audio stream with the polyvox.fm logo.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
				We can use these as a starting point to talk about what to
				park on polyvox.fm while we work to get the platform created.
			</p>
			<p>
				I fully acknowledge that both of these options may suck.
				However, it'll get the ball rolling!
